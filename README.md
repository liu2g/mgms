# Project Description
The MGMS is an IoT solution to help homeowners, garden enthusiasts, and farmers care for their lawns and gardens in a more informed and effective way while also reducing wasteful water usage.
This proof-of-concept system designed over the 2020/2021 fall and spring semesters utilizes an AVR microcontroller and IEEE 802.15.4 wireless communication to provide real-time and historical information about outdoor or indoor environmental conditions while providing customized recommendations for optimal plant care.
