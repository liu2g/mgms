\chapter{Design Activities}
\section{List of Attributes}
describes desired quality measures
\section{Objective Tree}
a hierarchical tree of relevant objectives that the design is to satisfy
\section{Pairwise Comparison Charts}
consider which design criteria are most important such as cost,
quality, expected product life, reliability, manufacturability, aesthetics, safety, etc. Compare alternative designs to find best one with respect to all these criteria.
