\section{Team Members}
	The group includes three students: \textbf{Alan Trester}, \textbf{Sadie Gladden}, and \textbf{Zuguang Liu}. \\
	
	Alan Trester ... \\
	
	Sadie Gladden ... \\
	
	Zuguang Liu is an Electrical Engineering student who has past Co-op experience in industrical system design, embedded system hardware design, and simple machine learning implementation. After finishing a Bachelor's Degree with a Embedded System minor, he continues to pursue a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering. 
	
\section{Technical Advisors} 

	We have contacted Dr. Zachariah Fuchs and Dr. Carla Purdy for advising this project. \\
	
	Dr. Zachariah Fuchs (\href{fuchsze@ucmail.uc.edu}{fuchsze@ucmail.uc.edu}) is the professor for Introduction to Mechatronics. He has extensive knowledge on embedded system design, sensor fusion, robotics and control systems. We believe he could advise us on the overall system architecture as well as specific conponents in the system. \\
	
	Dr. Carla Purdy (\href{purdyc@ucmail.uc.edu}{purdyc@ucmail.uc.edu}) is the professor for Embedded Systems with years of experience in Microcontroller and Microprocessor Design. She is also the advisor on Embedded Systems Minor. Her expertise will help us justify the project related to Embedded Systems, in order to fulfill the minor requirement for Alan and Liu. \\
