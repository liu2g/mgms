\section*{Problem Statement}
	Lawns and gardens are one of most essential elements for the typical American home. A survey conducted by National Association of Landscape Professionals in 2019 shows that 79 percent of American families value lawns when renting or buying a home, and about one in three Americans garden in their yards multiple times a week\cite{noauthor_new_2019}. \\
	
	Consequently, there is a constantly high demand of water for use in lawns and garden. Per the United States Environmental Protection Agency, about 48 gallons of water is devoted for this use per family per day. Across America, nearly 1/3 of all residential water is used for landscaping irrigation totaling an estimated 9 billion gallons per day\cite{epa_outdoor_nodate}. In a world undergoing climate change with consistent annual water shortages and wildfires in many parts of the world, wasteful water usage is simply unacceptable. \\
	
	The issue of wasteful irrigation is not being addressed as actively as it deserves to be. Although younger generations of Americans tend to value lawns and gardens even more than older generations, more than half of young people failed quizzes on proper landscape care and nearly 7 out of 10 young people wish to see further improvement in their lawns\cite{noauthor_new_2016}. Uninformed (and in turn, irresponsible) lawn care may significantly contribute to the amount of wasteful water usage happening every day.  \\
	
	We would like to propose an automation system to assist garden owners to manage their gardens efficiently as well as save resources such as water and money in the process.
	A 21st-century solution is needed to help new homeowners care for their lawns and gardens in a more informed and effective way while reducing the amount of wasteful water usage that is accounted for by residential lawn care and irrigation.

%		\item \textbf{LAWN OWNERS}
%		\item "81\% of americans have a lawn of some sort" 
%		\item "79\% say a lawn is an important factor when buying a home"

%		\item \textbf{WATER CONSUMPTION}
%		\item "The average American family uses 320 gallons of water per day, about 30 percent of which is devoted to outdoor uses. More than half of that outdoor water is used for watering lawns and gardens. Nationwide, landscape irrigation is estimated to account for nearly one-third of all residential water use, totaling nearly 9 billion gallons per day."
%		\item "In addition, some experts estimate that as much as 50 percent of water used for irrigation is wasted due to evaporation, wind, or runoff caused by inefficient irrigation methods and systems."

%		\item "Running a typical sprinkler from a standard garden hose (5/8‚Äù) for one hour uses about 1,020 gallons of water; if you run it three times per week, that is about 12,240 gallons per month. If you run the sprinkler three times a week during a 90-day billing cycle, you will add about 36,000 gallons of water to your usage."

\section*{Proposed Solution}


	We propose a wireless modular gardening system that can monitor garden or yard conditions such as but not exclusively soil temperature, moisture level, and sunlight levels. These modules should be able to wirelessly communicate with each other and a central hub. The central hub will then be able to use the analyze the data from the modules to display graphs of for better understanding of the garden environment. This information could be used to help determine what plants would thrive in that environment, watering amount and frequency, if certain fertilizers might be needed, etc. Other modular goals would be to include a watering module to help with watering the garden based on soil conditions. This module could be expanded to also take into account weather forecast and data to determine if rain would change the amount of water needed. These features would benefit everyday homeowners with a yard, hobbyist gardeners, and possibly industrial farmers. This project has significant value as it can save consumers money on water and help the environment by reducing overwatering and thus wasting water. 
	
	A proposed solution is a modular garden monitoring system that will be able to provide real time and historical information
	

\section*{Proposed Preliminary Features}
\noindent Essential features include
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiple measurement methods for garden environment, including water, sunlight, temperature, air, etc.,
	\item Feedback loop system to automatically control the environment,
	\item Modular design and a main controller compatible for multiple modules,
	\item Wireless communication protocol standard in the industry,
	\item Accessible and friendly user interface that visualizes information and suggestions.
\end{itemize}
Additional (nice-to-have) features include but not limit to
\begin{itemize}
	\item An algorithm to suggest vegetation based on the user's environment, and
	\item Integration with smart home devices (Alexa, Google Home, etc.).
\end{itemize}
	

%*PLEASE FIX ME*
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Create the individual garden modules with data collection capailities for attributes such as temperature, moisture level, sunlight level, etc. 
%	\item Create a central hub in order to analyze and format collected data from modules
%	\item Develop a watering module
%	\item Create a unique and easy to use user interface to access data, information, and suggestions
