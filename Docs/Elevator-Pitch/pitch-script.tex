\maketitle

Hello, my name is (Alan/Sadie/Liu) and I would like to talk to you about the project we are working on. It is an automated home garden system for your house. It auto-manages your garden environment by water, soil, sunlight, temperature, and air, whether it being indoor or outdoor. It saves your water, money, and time, and you don't have to worry about it when you are busy or on vacation. The system is modular so it is customizable to your plants' needs. If you don't have a garden and don't know what to grow, the system will give recommendations suitable to your environment. You will also be able to see and manage the environment yourself with the controller that it comes with. Depending on the budget and timeline, we also want to bring in other features such as integration with smart home devices. If you are interested in using or funding our project, let us know by phone number or email.
