\subsection*{Implementation}
\subsubsection*{Time}
The team plans to meet weekly using the Microsoft Teams videoconferencing application. This weekly meeting will occur every Tuesday for approximately 30 minutes starting at 3:30pm, and the work itself will be documented and shared using Teams and GitHub. The scheduled timeline is illustrated in a Gantt chart shown below. Tasks regarding the Implementation, Testing and Delivery phases are not reduced in detail as they depend on the result of the Design phase. \\
