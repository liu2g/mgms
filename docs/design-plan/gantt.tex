% \subsection*{Implementation}
% \subsubsection*{Time}
The team plans to meet weekly using the Microsoft Teams video conferencing application. This weekly meeting will occur every Tuesday for approximately 30 minutes starting at 3:30pm, and the work itself will be documented and shared using Teams and GitHub. The scheduled timeline is illustrated in a Gantt chart shown below. Tasks regarding the Implementation, Testing and Delivery phases are not reduced in detail as they depend on the result of the Design phase. \\

    \caption{Gantt chart that describes the projected timeline. Overall timeline is broken down into \textit{Definition}, \textit{Design}, \textit{Implementation}, \textit{Testing} and \textit{Delivery} phases with tasks. The current stage is in design as of today (\today), so the later phases are not described in detail. The expected delivery deadline is the date of senior design expo 2021.}
